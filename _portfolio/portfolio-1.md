My first project using GitHub involved practicing collaboration with my teammates. Together, we learned how to create repositories, checkout new branches, make changes to existing shared code documents, and manage pull requests. 

A second part of the assignment involved creating this website. I'll plan to continue to build this out over the course of the next few weeks, but this introduction has been helpful!
