Hi, I'm Rachel. I am a second-year doctoral student of Health Policy at UC Berkeley, where I also completed my Master of Public Health (MPH) degree in Health Policy & Management. My current research efforts are focused on health care quality and breast cancer care coordination, with a specific emphasis on patient engagement and team science. My instructional experience involves developing curriculum and leading discussion sections for a graduate-level introductory Health Policy & Management course, as well as providing support for both a residential and virtual version of a graduate-level Health Care Strategy course. Prior to graduate school, I developed my health policy interests as a Practice Facilitator for a CMS-led value-based payment iniative and a Research Assistant in a medical informatics lab. Outside of academia, my interests include classical ballet, discovering new podcasts, and spending time with my friends and family.

A Note About How I Coded This Website (and how you can, too!):
------

###### This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads.
